##In Step 1
- X_train = Training set.
- y_train = Training labels(In this text, Number is associated with activity labels.)
- subject_train = Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- x_test = Test set.
- y_test = Test labels.(Also, this text's number is associated with activity labels.)
- subject_test = Its range is also from 1 to 30.
- features = List of all features.
- activity labels = Links the class labels with their activity name.

------
## In other step
- train = An Object is consis of trains(e.g. X_train, y_train, subject_train).
- test = This object binds all of tests. 
- merged_data = Bind train and test object.
- n_list = List of column numbers that was included mean or standard variation.
- tidy_data = Cleaned data. you only use it.
